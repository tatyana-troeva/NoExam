"The local Blacklist is comparable to the WordPress Blacklist. However, the "

"makes sense when using NoSpamNX in blocking mode. The local Blacklist checks "
"the given values against the ip address, the author, the E-Mail Address, the "
"comment and the URL field of a comment. If a pattern matches, the comment "
"will be blocked. Please use one value per line. The local Blacklist is case-"
"insensitive."

"The global Blacklist gives you the possibility to use one Blacklist for "

"Blacklist (e.g. Webspace, Dropbox, etc. - but HTTP only) and put it into the "
"Field \"Update URL\". How you Built up your Blacklist (e.g. PHP-Script with "
"Database, simple Textfile, etc.) is up to, but you need to make sure, your "
"Update URL returns one value per line seperated by \"\\n\". Put the Update URL "
"in all your Blogs where you want your Blacklist, and setup the update "
"rotation according to your needs. The global Blacklist will be activated by "
"adding an Update URL. The global Blacklist is case-insensitive."
